COMM is a generic network communication library. You can add it to your
program to communicate easily across networks, with multiple clients,
in a server-client architecture. It is primarily threadless because
experience has shown threads are better avoided when at all possible when
stable code is required. When you have threads in your code, you MUST make
sure that you have a plan in place for how the threads will avoid deadlocks
and race conditions. The easiest way to avoid those problems is to not use
threads at all.

To accomplish this, COMM provides the function COMM_run() which will check
any operations that need to be done, and then return. This function should be
called frequently.
